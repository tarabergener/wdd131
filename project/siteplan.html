        <p>
            I chose this site name because this the name the business will go by.
            It will be easier to navigate to the site if the name describes exactly
            what you can purchase there.

        <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The site will be easy to navigate for users. It will allow users to shop
            as well as sign up for email subscriptions. The ultimate purpose is to provide
            a seemless shopping experience for each user, providing them with the option to
            filter their results, add/remove items to their cart, and get updates and 
            deals by email.
        </p>
        <h2>Scenarios</h2>
        <p id="">What deals do you offer on socks and ties?</p>
        <p>What makes these socks and ties different than other brands?</p>
        <p>What materials do you use to make your socks and ties?</p>
        <p>What is your return policy?</p>
        <p>I want to filter my results to just size small socks. Can I filter results?</p>
        <p>How can I contact support?</p>
